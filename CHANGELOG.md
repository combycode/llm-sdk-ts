## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Hosted MCP tool `tunnel_id` target (OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel) — reach a private/local MCP
  server with no public URL alongside the existing `server_url` / `connector_id` targets. The
  `mcp` builtin already forwards `params`; added the exported `McpToolParams` type for editor
  help and a regression test locking the forwarding. (Realtime MCP tooling tracked separately.)
- `ThinkingConfig.context` (`'auto' | 'current_turn' | 'all_turns'`) — maps to OpenAI's
  Responses `reasoning.context`, controlling which prior-turn reasoning items are rendered back
  to the model across a stateful conversation. OpenAI Responses-only; ignored by other providers.
- Inline moderation via the `moderation` request option on `complete()`/`stream()`
  (parity with OpenAI's `moderation` request field, extended to all providers). Report-only:
  results attach to `CompletionResponse.moderation` (`ModerationReport`) and never block the call.
  Native on the OpenAI provider (one round-trip on both Responses and Chat Completions); emulated
  via OpenAI's moderations endpoint on every other provider (`mode: 'native' | 'emulate'`).
  Streaming supports three strategies (`buffer` default / `parallel` / `post`) trading latency for
  how early the flag reaches the consumer, surfaced as a `moderation` stream event. Emulation
  requires an OpenAI key (reused from the client when it is the OpenAI provider, else
  `moderation.apiKey`); missing key throws.
- Unified `CompletionResponse.files` (`FileOutput[]`) - files produced by hosted tools
  (code execution, etc.), independent of `media`. The Anthropic adapter surfaces
  code-execution file outputs there by file id; OpenAI/Google/xAI producers to follow.
- Model catalog: new `ModelInfo.availability` field (`limited` / `preview`, vs default
  generally-available) so gated / early-access models are distinguishable from the
  `status` lifecycle. (Entries for specific limited/preview models are populated by the
  catalog pipeline.)
- Anthropic: the unified `code_interpreter` builtin now maps to Anthropic's hosted
  `code_execution` tool (GA on Messages) - it was previously silently skipped. Hosted
  code execution is now usable across Anthropic / OpenAI / Google through one interface.
- Google service tier, both directions (parity with OpenAI/Anthropic): a requested
  unified `serviceTier` (`flex`/`standard`/`priority`) maps to Google's top-level
  request field, and the billed `usageMetadata.serviceTier` is read back into
  `usage.serviceTier` / `usage.pricingTier` for tiered cost tracking.
  (New `providers/google/tiers.ts`.)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-13

First public release.

### Added
- Unified API across Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, and OpenRouter.
- Model catalog: normalised slug names, `model:tier` selectors, and
  capability-based `select()`.
- Tiered pricing with cost tracking and budget limits.
- Service tiers end to end (request → bill → cost).
- Cross-environment: runs on Node, Bun, and the browser. ESM, zero runtime deps.
