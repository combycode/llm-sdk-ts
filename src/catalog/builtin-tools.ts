/** Hosted server-side tools each provider's chat models support.
 *
 *  This is ADAPTER-SOURCED: it reflects what the provider adapters actually map
 *  the unified `{ type: 'web_search' | 'code_interpreter' }` builtins onto (each
 *  to the provider's native shape), verified by the live tools-parity test. It is
 *  applied PROVIDER-LEVEL to tool-capable (chat-family) models at catalog load —
 *  a deliberate first pass; a reliable per-model source can refine it later.
 *
 *  Coverage (verified live 2026-07):
 *    - web_search       → anthropic, openai, google, xai, openrouter
 *    - code_interpreter → anthropic, openai, google, xai   (NOT openrouter: it
 *      proxies function tools + its own plugins, but does not route hosted code
 *      execution — confirmed against the API).
 *    - web_fetch        → anthropic (web_fetch_20260318), google (urlContext).
 *      OpenAI has no separate fetch tool (its web_search does page-open); xAI /
 *      openrouter expose none.
 *    - image_generation → openai, xai (measured live 2026-10-01, through this
 *      library: `{ type: 'image_generation' }` on openai/gpt-5.6-sol,
 *      openai/gpt-5.4-nano, xai/grok-4.6, xai/grok-4.5 and xai/grok-4.3 all
 *      returned an image on `response.media`). It was absent for BOTH providers,
 *      including OpenAI where the tool has worked all along — so
 *      `supportsBuiltinTool(..., 'image_generation')` answered `false` about a
 *      tool that works, and a caller gating on the catalog refused itself. xAI
 *      additionally takes `action: 'auto' | 'generate' | 'edit'`, which is
 *      validated rather than inert: `action: 'paint'` is a 400 naming the three.
 *      The output needs no new parsing — xAI's REST item is OpenAI's
 *      `image_generation_call` with the same keys, not the
 *      `{__type:'image_generation_result'}` envelope its gRPC surface uses. */
