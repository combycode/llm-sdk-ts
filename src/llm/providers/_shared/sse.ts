/** The one piece of SSE handling every provider genuinely shares.
 *
 *  Report 035 proposed a shared "SSE -> StreamEvent parser" because the parsing
 *  looked duplicated ~5x. Measured, it is not: the six parse bodies (76-149
 *  lines each) share ZERO runs of three or more identical lines, because they
 *  decode different wire schemas — Anthropic's `content_block_*` events,
 *  OpenAI chat's `choices[].delta`, OpenAI Responses' typed events, and Google's
 *  `candidates[].content.parts`. A "shared" parser would be a switch on provider
 *  wearing a common signature.
 *
 *  What IS shared is exactly this line, repeated six times. Naming it gives the
 *  three language ports one primitive to agree on instead of six independent
 *  decisions, and one place to harden if malformed frames ever need handling
 *  (today a bad frame throws out of the parser, which is the existing
 *  behaviour and deliberately unchanged here).
